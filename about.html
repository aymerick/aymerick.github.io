            <p>
                I'm Aymerick, a software developer who lives near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennes">Rennes</a>, France.
            </p>
            <p>
                I work remotely as a full stack web developer since June 2008 at Fotonauts, a company founded by a group of ex-Apple engineers to create <a href="http://www.fotopedia.com">Fotopedia</a>, a photo community website.
            </p>
            <p>
                I met Fotonauts founders while working remotely as a contractor for Apple. During that mission I implemented the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncML">SyncML</a> protocol in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncML">iSync</a> synchronisation tool shipped with MacOS X. That protocol permitted to add support for tens of new mobile devices for Mac users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before that, I worked four years in the telecom industry, mainly on protocols on the server side (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol">WAP</a>  , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service">MMS</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Messaging_Service">EMS</a>...). I developed too on embeded devices for clients like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trium">Mitsubishi</a> and Philips.
