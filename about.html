                <p>
                    I am Aymerick, a software developer living near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennes">Rennes</a>, France.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently working on <a href="http://asso.ninja/">Asso Ninja</a>, a web service targeted to associations to help them create their website. This web service is powered by <a href="https://github.com/aymerick/kowa">kowa</a>, a static site manager I created in <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> with <a href="https://github.com/aymerick/kowa-client">an admin web app</a> I built with the <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before that, I worked remotely during more than six years as a full stack web developer at Fotonauts, a company founded by a group of ex-Apple engineers to create <a href="http://www.fotopedia.com">fotopedia</a>, a photo community website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am also involved in non-profit organizations like <a href="http://www.3ailes.org">3ailes</a>, <a href="http://www.williams-bretagne.org/">Williams Bretagne</a> and <a href="http://www.planet-williams.org/">Planet Williams</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a cool job proposition, I am available to hire.

                <h1>Fotopedia</h2>
                <h4>2008 - 2014</h4>
                <p>
                    I started at Fotonauts by setting up servers with <a href="http://puppetlabs.com">Puppet</a> then <a href="http://www.getchef.com">Chef</a>. I then developed several features:
                </p>
                <ul class="features">
                    <li><span>Photo upload</span> - It started as a <a href="http://www.merbivore.com">Merb</a> application, then became a (private) <a href="https://rubygems.org">gem</a> used by both the main <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a> application and by <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</a> scripts for batch photo-processing.</li>
                    <li><span>Async job infra</span> - The fotopedia app was highly asynchronous. We used <a href="https://github.com/resque/resque">Resque</a> with a <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> database to run asynchronous jobs.</li>
                    <li><span>Newsfeed</span> - After several iterations, including a custom <em>actors</em> architecture powered by <a href="http://rubyeventmachine.com">EventMachine</a>, I finally built the <a href="https://github.com/fotonauts/activr">Activr</a> gem that managed the activity feeds on fotopedia. <a href="https://github.com/fotonauts/activr">Activr</a> needs a MongoDB database, and it automatically hooks up with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a> and <a href="https://github.com/resque/resque">Resque</a>.</li>
                    <li><span>Reputation</span> - I developed a system Ã  la <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> to attribute points to fotopedia users when they perform <em>good</em> actions. It allowed to detect valuable contributors, to motivate users and it helps our internal curation team on their daily work by preventing trollers actions.</li>
                    <li><span>Achievements</span> - Yeah! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">Gamification</a>! Do stuff to earn badges!</li>
                    <li><span>Notifications / Newsletter</span> - Mail and web notifications, publishing of activities on facebook and twitter, and a custom newsletter system.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Although I have mainly done backend stuff, I also acquired experience in frontend development:
                </p>
                <ul class="features">
                    <li>I may not be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> gran masta, but I do know enough to feel confortable with it, and I know <a href="http://sass-lang.com">SASS</a>. Moreover, at Fotonauts we did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive design</a>, even for emails, yeah, thank you <a href="http://zurb.com/ink/">Ink</a>.</li>
                    <li>I participated in the development of the <a href="http://www.fotopedia.com/reporter">Reporter</a> section of the site that was built thanks to a custom <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a> framework created by our frontend team and that have, among other great features, an object layer similar to <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> one.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The Fotonauts team was based in Paris. Most of the time I worked from home at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betton,_Ille-et-Vilaine">Betton</a>, but one day a week I travelled to Paris to work with my amazing colleagues (and to drink some beers with them).

                <h1>Apple contractor</h2>
                <h4>2004 - 2007</h4>
                <p>
                    I met Fotonauts founders while working as a contractor for Apple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I implemented the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncML">SyncML</a> protocol in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISync">iSync</a> synchronisation tool that was shipped with MacOS X. The addition of the SyncML protocol into iSync permitted to add support for tens of new mobile devices for Mac users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During that mission, I was in direct contact with the development teams of several phone manufacturers like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia">Nokia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_ericsson">Sony-Ericsson</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola">Motorola</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked remotely and autonomously from Rennes, reporting to the Apple team located in Paris.

                <h1>Telecom industry</h2>
                <h4>2000 - 2004</h4>
                <p>
                    I worked four years in the telecom industry, mainly on protocols on the server side (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol">WAP  </a>  , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service">MMS</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Messaging_Service">EMS</a>, etc.). I also developed on mobile phones (the old ones, not the smart recent ones).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was a contractor, based in Rennes, for clients like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trium">Mitsubishi</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung">Samsung</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatel">Alcatel</a> and Philips.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During that period, I started to write my first open-source code as a side project: the <a href="https://github.com/aymerick/libwbxml-0.9.3">WBXML Library</a>, to parse and encode the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBXML">WBXML</a> format used by several wireless protocols at that time.
